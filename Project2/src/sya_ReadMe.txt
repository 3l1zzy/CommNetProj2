Run Instructions:
	1)  Open up the terminal window.
	2)  Type "cd "and then the file path to where the xxxxxxxxxx.java and 
	xxxxxxxxxx.java files are located and hit enter.
			Example: cd Desktop/school/s1/CommNet/Project2
	3)  Type "javac xxxxxxx.java" in the terminal and hit enter. This compiles the program and 
	adds a file called xxxxxxxx.class to your folder.
	4)  Type "java xxxxxxx" and type in the port number then hit enter. Your server 
	will now be running.
			Example: java xxxxxxxx 20700
			Note: If running on Google Cloud the run command will be "nohup java "xxxxxxxxx 20700 &"
	5)  Open a second terminal window. It is imperative you do not close the one you have 
	started the server on.

	xxxxxxxxxx.java files are located and hit enter.
			Example: cd Desktop/school/s1/CommNet/Project2
	7)  Type "javac xxxxxxxxx.java" in the terminal and hit enter. This compiles the 
	program and adds a file called xxxxxxxxxx.class to your folder.
	8)  Type "java xxxxxxxxxxx" and type in the credentials required. These include the 
	host, port number, and username. Each of these three are optional, but you will be 
	prompted to type in the username if you do not include it here. The other two 
	arguments will resort to default values embedded in the program. Each of these values 
	needs a key to be recognized as well. -h for host, -p for port, and -u for user.
			Example: java xxxxxxxxxxx -h hostName -u userName -p portName
	9)  You are now connected to the server and should be able to interact with it. Send 
	whatever messages you want by typing them in and hitting enter to send.
	10) To disconnect form the server type in "DONE" and hit enter. This must be its own 
	message.'
Conclusion: 
		I estimate this took xxxxxxx hours to complete. I sat down around ten and started 
		working on it until about xxxxxxxxxxxxx. I took breaks for meals and using the 
		bathroom as well as to rest since I got a really bad ear infection the other day a
		nd It's causing a lot of pain, though and I don't know how long those add up to. 
		The most difficult part for me xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
